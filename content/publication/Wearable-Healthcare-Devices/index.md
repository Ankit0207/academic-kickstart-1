abstract: Wearable healthcare devices offer tremendous promise to improve the health and well-being of individuals. Despite growing popularity of wearable healthcare devices, we have limited understanding about the actual use of these devices by US adults, and the key factors affecting the use.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The potential of healthcare wearable devices is under realized with less than one-third of US adults actively using it. With only young, healthier, wealthier, educated, techno-literate adults using wearables, other groups have been left behind. More concentrated efforts by clinicians, device makers and healthcare policy makers are needed to bridge this divide and improve the use of wearable devices among larger sections of American society.
