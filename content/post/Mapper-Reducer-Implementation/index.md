I  created a `Mapper-Reducer implementation` using basic features of Python to mimic Hadoop's mapper-reducer functionality. I used `Multi-threading` (explained later) to run parallel operations. I used Google Colab to run the model and you can find the required ["Pride_and_Prejudice.txt"] file [here](https://github.com/VipanchiKatthula/Mapper_Reducer_Implementation).

## Goal
First, let's map the words in the provided text to 1 using the mapper as `<Word,1>` and then use reducer to find the word count in the format `<Word,Count>`. A reducer also sorts the words which needs to be separately added to the series of operations. I implement the multi threading in python to parallelly get the word counts from two lists of words.

### Input File
```python
inputfile = open('/content/drive/My Drive/IDS561BigData/Assignment1/Pride_and_Prejudice.txt',"r")
text = inputfile.read()
```

### Data cleaning
In order for us to use the text from the book, we have to remove the the punctuations, unnecessary  numbers as they won't help us understand the text in most cases. 

We remove the numbers, convert the text to lower case using `.lower()` command and use Regular Expressions to replace punctuations with a space `' '`. I then remove those Lines with no text in them.
```
def data_clean(text):
  NoNumbers = ''.join([i for i in text if not i.isdigit()]) #Removing numbers
  NoNumbers = text.lower()                                  #Making the text to lower case
  import re
  onlyText = re.sub(r"[^a-z\s]+",' ',NoNumbers)             #Removing punctuation
  finaltext = "".join([s for s in onlyText.strip().splitlines(True) if s.strip()]) #Removing the null lines
  return finaltext
```

### Splitting data into two parts
Let's define a reusable function which takes a list of words as input to do multi-threading on the given data set. Here "a" is the number of words after you wish to make the split. For example, `splitlines(text,200)` will split the text into split1 and split2 as two sentences with first 1 to 199 words in split1 and rest in split2.
```
def splitlines(text,a):
  linessplit = text.splitlines() #Splitting the lines into a list
  split1 = linessplit[0:a]       #Creating the first split with the first "a" number of lines into split 1
  split2 = linessplit[a:]        #Creating the second split with the first "a" number of lines into split 2
  return split1,split2
```

### Mapper 
We map all the words in "text" to 1 using the `keyval.append([j,1])` command. So, the key here is the word and we apped a value of 1. The output format of the data is `<word,1>`.
```
def mapper(text,out_queue):
  keyval = []
  for i in text:
    wordssplit = i.split()
    for j in wordssplit:
      keyval.append([j,1])      #Appending each word in the line with 1 and storing it in ["word",1] format in a nested list
  out_queue.put(keyval)
```

### Sorting Function
As we have two lists of separate key-value pairs after the split function, now we define sortging function to handle both the lists. We  take two inputs and return only one output which which contains the sorted list of word key value pairs.
```
def sortedlists(list1,list2):
  out = list1 + list2             #Appending the two input lists into a single list
  out.sort(key= lambda x :x[0])   #Sorting the lists based on the first element of the list which is the "word"
  return out
```



### Partition 
The below code creates two lists of sorted words in alphabetical order and then we separate the words starting with a-m and n-z. The function returns the sorted lists which will be inputs to the reducer function.
```
def partition(sorted_list) :
 sort1out = []
 sort2out = []
 for i in sorted_list:
    if i[0][0] < 'n':             #Partitioning the sorted word list into two separate lists 
      sort1out.append(i)          #with first list containing words starting with a-m and n-z into second
    else : sort2out.append(i)
 return sort1out,sort2out
```

### Reducer

```
def reducer(part_out1,out_queue) :
  sum_reduced = []
  count = 1
  for i in range(0,len(part_out1)):
    if i < len(part_out1)-1:
      if part_out1[i] == part_out1[i+1]:
       count = count+1                              #Counting the number of words
      else : 
       sum_reduced.append([part_out1[i][0],count])  #Appending the word along with count to sum_reduced list as ["word",count]
       count = 1 
    else: sum_reduced.append(part_out1[i])          #Appending the last word to the output list    
  out_queue.put(sum_reduced)
```

### Multi - Threading function
The user defined function below takes a function and two inputs as arguments. The function is applied on both the inputs simultaneously and the output is returned by the function.
```
import threading
import queue
def multi_thread_function(func,map1_input,map2_input):  #func is the function to be used with two threads taking two inputs map1_input and map2_input
  my_queue1 = queue.Queue()  #Using queue to store the values of mapper output to use them in sort function
  my_queue2 = queue.Queue()
  t1 = threading.Thread(target=func, args=(map1_input,my_queue1)) 
  t2 = threading.Thread(target=func, args=(map2_input,my_queue2))  
  t1.start()                 #Starting the execution of thread1
  t2.start()                 #Starting the execution of thread2 to run simultaneously with thread1
  t1.join()                  #Waiting for the thread1 to be completely executed
  t2.join()                  #Waiting for the thread2 to be completely executed
  list1out = my_queue1.get() #Getting the values from the queue into a variable to return its value
  list2out = my_queue2.get()
  return list1out,list2out
```

### Mapper-Reducer
Finally, we combine all the above functions to split the lines after 5000 words and them implement the entire Mapper Reducer operation which mimics the way Hadoop's handles the data.
```
def main_function(text):  
  cleantext = data_clean(text)
  linessplit = splitlines(cleantext,5000)
  mapperout = multi_thread_function(mapper,linessplit[0],linessplit[1]) 
  sortedwords = sortedlists(mapperout[0],mapperout[1])
  slicedwords = partition(sortedwords)
  reducerout = multi_thread_function(reducer,slicedwords[0],slicedwords[1])
  return reducerout[0]+reducerout[1]

output = main_function(text)
import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame(output).to_csv("Output.csv",index=False,header = ["Word","Frequency"]) #Saving file as a .csv file in the current directory
```
