I'm a passionate Data Scientist with 3+ years of experience, currently pursuing Masters in Business Analytics at **University of Illinois at Chicago** with specialization in Data Science. I am excited to combine my experience and knowledge from Grad school in dealing with real life problems. I have written multiple blog posts on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/@vipanchikatthula) and on this website on various machine learning concepts to extend my contribution to the data science community.

I love working on [innovative projects](https://github.com/VipanchiKatthula) and developing [applications](https://github.com/users/VipanchiKatthula/projects/5) for business use. I enjoy the art of photography and also worked as a freelance graphic designer.
