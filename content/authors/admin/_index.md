I'm a passionate Data Scientist with 3+ years of exprience, currently pursuing Masters in Business Analytics at **University of Illinois at Chicago** with specialization in Data Science. I'm working with [Prof Ranga](https://business.uic.edu/profiles/chandrasekaran-ranganathan/) as an **Machine Learning researcher** and co-authored "Use of Wearable Healthcare Devices by US adults: Patterns of Use and Key Predictors" [[Link](https://preprints.jmir.org/preprint/22443/accepted)]. 

I am excited to combine my experience and knowledge from Grad school in dealing with real life problems. I have written multiple blog posts on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/@vipanchikatthula) and on this website on various machine learning concepts to extend my contribution to the data science community.
